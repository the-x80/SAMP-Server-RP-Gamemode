# SAMP-Server-RP-Gamemode


<b>Info</b>
<p>
  San Andreas Multiplayer Roleplay Gamemode entirely written in C++.
</p>
<p>
<p><b>Methodology</b></p>
<p>
  Since SA:MP servers dont support C++ gamemodes inherently I've opted to write it as a Plugin to the server and the AMX gamemode is written to be as bare as possible.
