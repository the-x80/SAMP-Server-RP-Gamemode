# SAMP-Server-RP-Gamemode


<b>Info</b>
<p>
  San Andreas Multiplayer Roleplay Gamemode entirely written in C++.
</p>
<p>
  Still in early developement so a lot of the planned features are missing.
</p>
<p>
<p><b>Methodology</b></p>
<p>
  Since SA:MP servers dont support C++ gamemodes inherently I've opted to write it as a Plugin to the server and the AMX gamemode is written to be as bare as possible.
</p>
</p>

<p><b><i>Planned features</i></b>(List not complete)</p>
<p>
  <p><i>Inventory System</i>
    <p>Planned to be split into character inventory(the things the character can carry only on himself), backpack inventory, vehicle inventory.</p>
  </p>
  <p><i>Economy system</i>
    <p>As an effort to decrease the possibility of inflation this system will be set in place.</p>
  </p>
