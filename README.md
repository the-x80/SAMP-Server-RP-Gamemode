# SAMP-Server-RP-Gamemode


<b>Info</b>
<p>
  San Andreas Multiplayer Roleplay Gamemode entirely written in C++.
</p>
<p>
  Still in early developement so a lot of the planned features are missing.
  The plan is to host the gamemode on a server where anyone can join and test out any feature.
  Ofcourse some features will be behing a Permission system for obvious reasons.
</p>
<p>
<p><b>Methodology</b></p>
<p>
  Since SA:MP servers dont support C++ gamemodes inherently I've opted to write it as a Plugin to the server and the AMX gamemode is written to be as bare as possible.
</p>
</p>

**Planned features**(List not complete)
-Inventory System-
  -Planned to be split into character inventory(the things the character can carry only on himself), backpack inventory, vehicle inventory.</p>
 -Economy system</i>
   -As an effort to decrease the possibility of inflation this system will be set in place.
